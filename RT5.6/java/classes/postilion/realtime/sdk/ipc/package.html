This packages encapsulates a generic communications infrastructure.
<p>
	
<!-- Put @see and @since tags down here. -->
Communications in the Postilion Realtime Framework is built on top of essentially 
two abstractions, namely <em>saps</em> (Service Access Points) and <em>endpoints</em>.
<P>
Saps are essentially Endpoint factories. Two types of sap are defined: a client and 
a server sap. They differ in the state of the endpoint they produce. A client sap
produces disconnected endpoints that must then be connected to a remote entity.
A server sap produces endpoints that are already connected and represent a newly
established connection.
