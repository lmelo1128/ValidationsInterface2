This package encapsulates the Postilion Realtime Node SDK.
<P>
This provides a generic, extensible framework for developing
Postilion Realtime Terminal Driving Interfaces and Network 
(or Interchange) Interfaces.
</P>
<P>
Terminal Drivers are driven by the {@link PosEntityProcessor}
class. Communications is also handled by this class. Terminal Drivers
are backed by the {@link APosEntity} <em>driver</em> class.
</P>
<P>
Network Interfaces are driven by the {@link InterchangeProcessor}
class. Communications is handled by the {@link Interchange}
or {@link PosEntityEmulatorInterchange} class. Each of these classes
is backed by a <em>driver</em> class, {@link AInterchangeDriver}
and {@link APosEntityEmulator} respectively.
</P>
<P>
{@link SplitSinkInterchange} and {@link SplitSinkPosEntityEmulatorInterchange} 
are extensions that provides a standardized solution when 
authorization involving more than one Sink Node. Network 
Interfaces can be combined with these extensions to 
leverage existing functionality without requiring custom extensions.
</P>
<P>
The communications functionality provided by the Node SDK
can also be customized through the use of an {@link ASapFactory}
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Node SDK exposes, and maintains, a number of useful
Performance Counters through the Build Framework and the 
Performance Monitoring Framework (see 
{@link postilion.realtime.sdk.util.perfmon.PerfMap}.
