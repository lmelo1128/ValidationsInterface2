This package provides a facade for marshalling between XML documents and Java objects.
<P>
This implementation is backed by the <a target=_top href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/jaxb/">JAXB</a>
XML binding framework and the <a target=_top href="http://xerces.apache.org/">Xerces</a>
DOM XML parser.
</P>
<P>
Validation of the content of an XML document during the marshalling process is 
also possible.
