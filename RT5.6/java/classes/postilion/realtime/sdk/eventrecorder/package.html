This packages encapsulates a generic event reporting framework.
<P>
	
<!-- Put @see and @since tags down here. -->
The Event Recorder Framework essentially consists of the following:
<OL>
	<LI>The EventRecorder: A central entity responsible for accepting and recording events.</LI>
	<LI>A collection of Scribes: A scribe is an entity that is responsible for monitoring and 
		possibly reporting events that are raised within the system. This could mean either tracking 
		the event (as part of a trend) or reporting the event, or both.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>
The EventRecorder decouples applications from the <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> of event logging. Scribes 
are responsible for deciding which events to log (the <em>when</em>) and what form that logging
takes (<em>how</em>).
</P>
<P>
Scribes may themselves record new events. An example of this would be scribes that perform trend monitoring.
When a trend threshold is tripped a new event may be raised to report this fact to a user. 
</P>
<P>
Events are recorded by passing them to a method on the {@link postilion.realtime.sdk.eventrecorder.EventRecorder} class. 
</P>
<P>
Events are defined much like they are for the Windows eventlog and the support framework 
today. An input file defines the event in a parameterized language neutral way. A set 
of categories is defined (this set is extensible) and each event may be marked as belonging 
to one or more categories. This provides a flexible way of 'typing' events and makes 
it possible for scribes to quickly select the subset of all events they are 
interested in. Categories are defined by a class hierarchy rooted at 
{@link postilion.realtime.sdk.eventrecorder.ACategory}
</P>
<P>
Events also have context associated with them. Context is information about the 'entities' 
within the system that are affected by the event. Contexts are also defined by a class
hierarchy, rooted at {@link postilion.realtime.sdk.eventrecorder.AContext}. The types of
context typically associated with an event may include 
<OL>
	<LI>A sap </LI>
	<LI>An endpoint</LI> 
	<LI>An interchange </LI>
	<LI>A terminal </LI>
	<LI>An application </LI>
	<LI>A cryptographic key </LI>
	<LI>A node </LI>
	<LI>An exception</LI> 
</OL>
Not all types of context will necessarily be available (or even make sense) when the 
event is raised. An initial set of types of context that may be associated with the 
event is defined by this SDK but this set is extensible.
</P>
<P>
Context is strongly typed, making it possible for scribes to include the context of an 
event in the decision making process. For example, a scribe may wish to track 
cryptographic errors (determined by the category of an event) for a particular cryptographic 
key (determined by examining the context associated with an event). 
</P>
<P>
In addition to this, the framework is extensible making it possible to plug in custom scribe 
implementations. To this end an interface is defined which must be implemented by scribes. 
These scribes may register to be notified when certain types of events are raised. The 
scribe is then passed the event and given a chance to decide what to do with that event.
